### White-Labeling
The practice of removing branding from a product so it can be rebranded and resold by other businesses.

## Technical Terms

### AI Service Abstraction Layer
A code layer that provides a unified interface to multiple AI providers, allowing the application to switch between them seamlessly.

### Email Service Layer
A system that provides a unified interface for sending transactional emails using Resend, with React-based email templates.

### Prompt Management System
A system for storing, versioning, and optimizing prompts used for AI interactions.

### Feature Flags
Configuration options that allow features to be enabled or disabled without changing code.

### Progressive Enhancement
A web design strategy that emphasizes core content and functionality first, then progressively adds more complex layers for browsers that can handle them.

### A/B Testing Framework
A system for comparing two versions of a webpage or feature to determine which performs better.

## Project Structure

### Marketing Components

## Development Workflow

### Code Generation Utilities
Tools that automatically generate boilerplate code based on templates.

Carefully crafted instructions for AI assistants to help with specific development tasks.

### Customization Points
Specific areas in the codebase designed to be easily modified for different product types.

### Deployment Scripts
Automated scripts that handle the process of deploying the application to production.
