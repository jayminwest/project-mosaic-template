# Project Mosaic Overview

## What is Project Mosaic?

Project Mosaic is a 12-week initiative to rapidly develop, launch, and iterate on multiple micro-SaaS products. The goal is to build 6-9 profitable micro-SaaS products that collectively generate $3,000+ in monthly recurring revenue, creating a portfolio of small pieces that together form something valuable.

## Core Strategy

- **Rapid Development**: Complete product cycles in 1-2 weeks per product
- **Portfolio Approach**: Spread risk across multiple products (like a personal VC firm)
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI for code generation and optimization
- **Progressive Automation**: Increase automation with each product cycle
- **Reflection Periods**: Dedicated weeks for improvement and optimization

## Technical Foundation

All products are built on a common technical foundation:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Analytics**: Plausible/Google Analytics
- **AI Integration**: Provider-agnostic interfaces for multiple AI services

## Development Philosophy

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with core functionality and expand based on user feedback
2. **Reuse Components**: Leverage the shared template and component library
3. **AI-First Design**: Structure code and documentation for optimal AI assistance
4. **Revenue Focus**: Prioritize features that directly impact conversion and retention
5. **Accept Strategic Technical Debt**: Move fast during sprints, refine during reflection weeks

## Product Selection Criteria

Products are selected based on:

1. **Development Time**: Can be built within 2-3 days (excluding template setup)
2. **Revenue Model**: Primary subscription with optional lifetime access
3. **Market Validation**: Addresses clear pain points with existing demand
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Leverages existing APIs and template components
5. **Business Viability**: Can generate revenue within first month

## Success Metrics

- **Per Product**: Customer acquisition cost, monthly recurring revenue, retention rate
- **Overall Program**: Total MRR, number of profitable products, development efficiency

## Implementation Approach

1. Use the shared SaaS template as the foundation
2. Customize for the specific product use case
3. Implement product-specific features
4. Create marketing assets and launch
5. Analyze performance and iterate
6. Document learnings for future products

## Documentation Standards

All projects should maintain:

1. **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design and component relationships
3. **CUSTOMIZATION.md**: Guide for adapting the template
4. **AI_DOCS/**: Documentation optimized for AI assistance

## Contribution to Project Mosaic

This product is part of the Project Mosaic portfolio. When enhancing this project, consider how improvements might benefit other products in the portfolio or be abstracted into the shared template.
