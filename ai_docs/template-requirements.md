# Project Mosaic SaaS Template Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for adapting the Task App micro-SaaS template to serve as the foundation for Project Mosaic - a 12-week initiative to build multiple micro-SaaS products rapidly. The template must support quick deployment of diverse micro-SaaS products while maintaining high quality and scalability.

## Core Objectives

1. **Rapid Development**: Enable complete product development cycles in 1-2 weeks
2. **Consistent Architecture**: Maintain a unified approach across all products
3. **AI-First Design**: Integrate AI capabilities throughout the product lifecycle
4. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Support growth from zero to thousands of users
5. **Flexible Customization**: Allow quick adaptation for different product types

## Technical Requirements

### Foundation Components

- **Next.js Framework** with TypeScript and React 18+
- **Supabase Integration** for authentication, database, and storage
- **Stripe Subscription** system with multiple pricing tiers
- **Responsive UI** using Tailwind CSS with dark/light mode
- **Testing Infrastructure** with Jest and React Testing Library

### AI Integration Layer

- **Provider-Agnostic Interface** supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Prompt Management System** for storing, versioning, and optimizing prompts
- **Context Management** for maintaining conversation history
- **Fallback Mechanisms** for service unavailability
- **Model Selection Configuration** based on task requirements

### Service Abstraction

- **Dependency Injection** system for all external services
- **Configuration Validation** at startup
- **Graceful Degradation** when services are unavailable
- **Unified Error Handling** across integrations
- **Environment Variable Management** with validation

### Marketing Components

- **Landing Page Generator** with customizable sections
- **Email Sequence Templates** with AI content generation
- **Social Media Announcement Components** for cross-platform sharing
- **SEO Optimization** tools for landing pages
- **A/B Testing Framework** for conversion optimization

### Analytics & Metrics

- **Unified Dashboard** for tracking all products
- **Conversion Funnel Visualization** with drop-off analysis
- **Revenue Tracking** with MRR and churn metrics
- **User Engagement Scoring** with AI-powered insights
- **ROI Calculator** for marketing campaigns

### Developer Experience

- **AI-Centric Documentation** structure optimized for AI assistance
- **Specialized Prompts** for different development phases
- **Code Generation Utilities** for common patterns
- **Automated Deployment Scripts** for quick launches
- **Component Library** with consistent styling

## Implementation Priorities

1. **AI Service Abstraction Layer**
   - Create provider-agnostic interfaces for multiple AI providers
   - Implement configuration for model selection and fallbacks
   - Add prompt management system with versioning
   - Create fallback mechanisms for service outages

2. **Marketing Automation**
   - Develop landing page generator with customizable sections
   - Create email sequence templates with AI content generation
   - Implement social media announcement components
   - Add Google Ads API integration for campaign management

3. **Analytics & Metrics Dashboard**
   - Build unified dashboard pulling data from all products
   - Implement conversion funnel visualization
   - Add revenue and user engagement metrics tracking
   - Create A/B testing infrastructure with variant assignment

4. **White-Labeling & Customization**
   - Enhance theme customization system
   - Add logo and branding replacement utilities
   - Implement custom domain configuration
   - Create legal document templates (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Create AI-centric documentation structure
   - Develop specialized prompts for different development phases
   - Add code generation utilities for common patterns
   - Implement automated deployment scripts

## Product Types to Support

The template should be adaptable for these product categories:

1. **Content Tools**: Calendars, generators, schedulers
2. **Marketing Tools**: Testimonial collectors, social proof widgets
3. **Developer Tools**: Repository access, code delivery, documentation
4. **Productivity Tools**: Meeting notes, task management, time tracking
5. **Business Tools**: Invoicing, metrics dashboards, email tools

## Technical Architecture Guidelines

1. **Modular Design**: Components should be self-contained and reusable
2. **Feature Flags**: All features should be toggleable via configuration
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality should work without JavaScript
4. **Mobile-First**: All interfaces must be fully responsive
5. **Performance Budget**: Initial load under 2 seconds, interactions under 100ms
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
7. **Security**: Follow OWASP best practices for all implementations
8. **Privacy**: GDPR and CCPA compliance built into the core

## Documentation Requirements

1. **GLOSSARY.md**: Key concepts and code patterns
2. **Architecture Documentation**: System design optimized for AI understanding
3. **Specialized Prompts**: For different development phases
4. **Customization Guide**: Common modification points with examples
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Solutions for common issues

## Success Criteria

The template will be considered successful if it enables:

1. Complete product development in 1-2 weeks per product
2. Consistent quality across all products
3. Seamless integration of AI capabilities
4. Flexible adaptation to different product types
5. Scalable infrastructure that grows with user base
6. Maintainable codebase that can evolve over time

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with the existing Task App template as the foundation
2. Implement enhancements in order of priority
3. Test each enhancement with a real product use case
4. Document all changes and customization points
5. Create specialized AI prompts for each development phase

This template will serve as the foundation for building 6-9 profitable micro-SaaS products over a 12-week period, with the goal of generating $3,000+ in monthly recurring revenue.
